# Pydata Tutorial 2017 - Jupyter Notebooks for Geospatial Data Analysis

This tutorial was given during PyData London on 5 May 2017. <br>

Examples specifically from Climate Sciences show, how large volumes of geospatial data can be accessed processed and visualised  on-demand, with the help of standardised web services.  <br>


The tutorial can be followed interactively via

UPDATE 2019: 
* the OGC service this tutorial gives as an example has unfortunately been switched off. However, the tutorial still gives an idea about how OGC WCS requests work.
